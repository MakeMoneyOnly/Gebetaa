### Quote

_"I know I'm leaving money on the table every day. My best servers upsell drinks and desserts, but my average servers just take the order. I have no idea which dishes are actually making me money versus which ones just look popular. And every time inflation hits, I spend $600 reprinting menus that are outdated in two weeks. I need something that helps me make smarter decisions without costing me an arm and a leg."_

### Quote

_"I have five locations and five different menus. Every time I want to change a price or add a new dish, it's a three-day project. I have no idea which items are actually driving profit at each location - some dishes are popular in one area but not another. My staff turnover is 80%, so I'm constantly training new people on systems that are different at each location. I need one platform that gives me control over everything, with data that helps me make smarter decisions across the entire chain."_

### Quote

_"I'm running on a shoestring budget. Every birr counts. I know I'm losing money because I don't know what's selling and what's not. My staff forgets to suggest pastries with coffee, and I'm sure I'm missing out on upsells. I can't afford a fancy POS system that costs more than my rent. I need something simple that helps me understand my business and make more money, without breaking the bank."_
