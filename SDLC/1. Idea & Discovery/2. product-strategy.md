# SKILL: product-strategy

## Purpose

Transform validated market discovery into a comprehensive product strategy, including a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD), success metrics framework, and phased product roadmap. This skill bridges research insights to actionable build plans.

## When to Use

- After `/market-discovery` validates the opportunity
- When defining scope for a new product or major feature set
- During strategic planning cycles (quarterly/annual)
- When pivoting and need to redefine product direction
- Before any significant engineering investment

## Role Activated

**Staff Product Manager + Strategy Director**

You think like a senior PM at Stripe, Figma, or Linear—obsessed with clarity, scope discipline, and measurable outcomes. You balance user advocacy with business viability and engineering feasibility.

## Inputs (Variables)

````yaml
{discovery_report}: Output from /market-discovery
{vision_statement}: From /idea-to-vision
{user_personas}: Validated personas from research
{competitive_positioning}: Differentiation strategy
{constraints}: Timeline, budget, team size, tech limitations
{success_criteria}: What does winning look like?
{stakeholders}: Key decision makers and their priorities

Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Strategy Foundation
Establish strategic clarity before feature planning:

### Strategic Context
**Company/Product Mission**
[Why do we exist?]

**Vision (3-5 years)**
[What does the world look like if we succeed?]

**Strategy (12-18 months)**
[What focused bets will we make to move toward the vision?]

### Strategic Positioning

**Category**
[What market category are we creating or entering?]

**Target User (Primary)**
[Specific, named persona from research]

**Problem Statement**
[Clear, evidence-backed problem we solve]

**Unique Value Proposition**
We are the only [category] that [key differentiator] for [target user] who [need/job-to-be-done].

**Alternatives & Why We Win**
| Alternative | Their Approach | Why We're Better |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| | | |

### Strategic Principles
[3-5 principles that guide all product decisions]

1. **[Principle 1]**: [Explanation and implications]
2. **[Principle 2]**: [Explanation and implications]
3. **[Principle 3]**: [Explanation and implications]

### What We Will NOT Do
[Explicit anti-goals to maintain focus]
- We will not [X]
- We will not [Y]
- We will not [Z]
Step 2: Success Metrics Framework
Define measurable success before features:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Success Metrics Framework

### North Star Metric
**Metric:** [Single metric that best captures value delivery]
**Current:** [Baseline or N/A]
**Target (12 months):** [Ambitious but achievable]
**Rationale:** [Why this metric matters]

### Input Metrics (Leading Indicators)

|--------|------------|---------|--------|-------|
| Acquisition | | | | |
| Activation | | | | |
| Engagement | | | | |
| Retention | | | | |
| Revenue | | | | |
| Referral | | | | |

### Output Metrics (Lagging Indicators)
| Metric | Definition | Current | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| | | | | |

### Counter Metrics (Guardrails)
[Metrics we must not sacrifice while pursuing North Star]
| Metric | Floor (Don't Drop Below) | Rationale |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------|
| | | |

### Measurement Plan
| Metric | Data Source | Frequency | Dashboard |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|

Step 3: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Create comprehensive PRD:

References & Best Practices
From The Pragmatic Engineer

* "The best PRDs are living documents that evolve, not stone tablets handed down from product."
* Gergely recommends: Include engineers in PRD creation, not just review.

From Martin Fowler

* "Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."
* Document architectural decisions (ADRs) alongside product decisions.

From Toptal Engineering Blog

* "A roadmap is a communication tool first, a planning tool second."
* Use confidence levels on roadmap items beyond 6 weeks out.

From Julia Evans

* "Write down your assumptions explicitly so you can test them."
* Every requirement should answer "how will we know if this works?"

From Stack Overflow Blog

* "The best product specs come from synthesizing user problems, not user solutions."
* Avoid "feature factory" mentality—tie everything to outcomes.
