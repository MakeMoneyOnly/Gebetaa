**Status:** DRAFT
**Date:** 2026-02-04

**Context:** This artifact bridges Idea/Discovery to Actionable Engineering.

## 1. Product Strategy Foundation

### Vision
**Gebeta** (working title) becomes the operating system for restaurants in emerging markets, starting by solving the "Menu Inflation" problem and evolving into a full-stack restaurant intelligence platform.

### Strategic Positioning
*   **Category:** Restaurant Infrastructure Platform (NOT just a "Digital Menu").
*   **Target User:** Small-to-Medium restaurant owners in high-inflation economies.
*   **Unique Value Proposition:** The only platform that combines *Offline-First Reliability*, *Inflation-Proof Pricing Management*, and *AI-driven Upselling* in a lightweight, affordable package.

### Principles
1.  **Offline-First:** If it doesn't work when the internet cuts out, it doesn't work.
2.  **WhatsApp-Simple:** If a user needs a manual to use the Admin dashboard, we failed.
3.  **Speed is Revenue:** Menu load time must be < 2s. Slow menus = lost customers.

### Anti-Goals (What we will NOT do in MVP)
*   **No Hardware:** We will not ship tablets or POS devices. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).
*   **No Delivery Marketplace:** We are not UberEats. We don't do logistics.
*   **No Consumer App:** Web-only (PWA) for diners. No App Store friction.

## 2. Success Metrics Framework

### North Star Metric
*   **Weekly Active Locations (WAL):** Number of restaurants that update their menu or receive an order/scan in the last 7 days.

### Input Metrics (Leading)
*   **Menu Scans per Location:** Usage intensity.
*   **Upsell Conversion Rate:** % of diners accepting a recommendation.
*   **Admin Session Frequency:** How often owners manage their "store".

## 3. Product Requirements Document (PRD) - MVP

### 3.1 Scope

**In Scope (P0 - Critical):**
1.  **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Support `agency`, `merchant`, `consumer` roles.
2.  **Public Menu Interface (Consumer):**
    *   QR entry point `gebeta.com/[slug]`.
    *   Category/Item browsing.
    *   Search.
    *   "Call Waiter" button.
3.  **Merchant Dashboard (Admin):**
    *   CRUD Menu (Categories, Items, Modifiers).
    *   Price Management (Bulk updates).
    *   QR Code generation.
4.  **Agency Dashboard (Super Admin):**
    *   Onboard/Disable Restaurants.
    *   Platform-wide analytics.

**In Scope (P1 - Differentiation):**
1.  **Smart Upselling:** "Pairing" suggestions.
2.  **Basic Analytics:** Verified Scans, Top Items.

### 3.2 User Stories (Core)

| ID | Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-1** | As an **Owner**, I want to update prices instantly so I don't lose margin on inflation. | Change price in Admin -> Reflects on Consumer view in < 1s. | **P0** |
| **US-2** | As a **Diner**, I want to view the menu without downloading an app so I can order quickly. | Scan QR -> Menu loads in mobile browser. | **P0** |
| **US-3** | As an **Agency**, I want to create new restaurant tenants so I can sell subscriptions. | "Create Tenant" form -> Generates unique slug & admin login. | **P0** |
| **US-4** | As a **Waiter**, I want to be notified when a table needs me so I can serve them efficiently. | Diner clicks "Call Waiter" -> Notification on Merchant Dashboard. | **P1** |
| **US-5** | As an **Owner**, I want simple analytics to know what is selling. | Dashboard shows "Top 5 Items" and "Total Views" daily. | **P1** |

## 4. Technical Architecture (High Level Strategy)

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router). PWA manifesto for installability.
*   **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime).
*   **State:** React Query (TanStack Query) for offline caching/sync.
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS + Glassmorphism (Premium Feel).
