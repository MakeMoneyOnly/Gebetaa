## 1. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

### Context: Emerging Markets (Focus: Ethiopia / East Africa)

*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** All Food & Beverage businesses in East Africa.
    *   *Estimate:* ~500,000 locations.
    *   *Value:* ~$500M annual recurring revenue (ARR) potential at $100/mo avg (very long term).

*   **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** Mid-to-High end dining + Fast Casual in urban centers (Addis Ababa, Nairobi) with internet connectivity.
    *   *Estimate:* ~20,000 locations (Addis Ababa alone has ~5,000 registered suitable establishments).
    *   *Constraint:* Must have reliable 3G/4G and smartphone adoption.

*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Early adopters in Addis Ababa (Bole, Kazanchis areas) looking for cost-cutting due to inflation.
    *   *Target:* 500 locations in Year 1.

## 2. User Personas

### Primary Persona: The Stressed Owner ("Ato Solomon")
*   **Profile:** 45-55 years old, owns 2 branches of a popular lounge/restaurant.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   **Inflation:** "I printed menus last week, and beef prices went up yesterday. I'm losing money on every steak."
    *   **Staff Theft/Inefficiency:** "I don't know what my waiters are doing."
    *   **Cost:** "I can't afford $500 for a POS system."
*   **Motivations:** Increasing margin, looking "modern" to customers, stopping the bleeding from reprinting costs.
*   **Tech Literacy:** Uses WhatsApp and Facebook daily, but fears "complex" software.

### Secondary Persona: The Overwhelmed Waiter ("Dawit")
*   **Profile:** 23 years old, university student working part-time.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   "Customers get angry when I say the price is different from the menu."
    *   "I have to run to the kitchen to ask if we have Tilapia today."
    *   "I want more tips."
*   **Fears:** "Will this QR thing replace me?"
*   **Opportunity:** If the system makes his job easier (Call Waiter button) and increases table turnover (more tips), he becomes a champion.

### User Persona: The Modern Diner ("Helen")
*   **Profile:** 29 years old, bank employee, dines out 3x/week.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   "I hate waving my hand for 10 minutes to get the bill."
    *   "The paper menu is dirty/sticky."
    *   "I want to see what the food looks like before I order."
*   **Preferences:** Good internet (WiFi), fast loading, nice photos.

## 3. Competitive Analysis (Deep Dive)

| Competitor | Type | Price | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Toast / Square** | Enterprise POS | $200+/mo + Hardware | Powerful, Integrated, Reliable | Way too expensive, US-centric, Requires reliable internet/Hardware. |
| **Menu Tiger / QR** | SaaS Menu | Freemium - $15/mo | Easy setup, cheap | "Dumb" menus (PDF/Static), No upselling logic, Generic design not "Premium". |
| **Physical Menu** | Traditional | $200-800 per print run | Familiar, Tactile, No battery needed | **Static prices** (Major flaw in inflation), Dirty, No data, expensive to update. |
| **WhatsApp/Telegram** | Social | Free | Ubiquitous, Direct comms | No structured data, manual order handling, no analytics. |

**Our Winning Wedge:**
We are the **"Smart Menu"**: Cheaper than Toast, Smarter than PDF, cleaner than Physical.

## 4. Validation Matrix

| Assumption | Evidence Level | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inflation drives demand** | **High.** Market data shows 15-30% inflation. Reprinting is a mathematical loss. | **VALIDATED** |
| **Upselling increases Revenue** | **High.** Industry standard (Toast data) shows 15-30% lift with digital prompts. | **VALIDATED** |
| **Owners will pay subscription** | **Medium.** emerging markets prefer "One-time" usually. Need to frame as "Less than 1 reprint cost". | **TEST REQUIRED** |
| **Data connectivity is adequate** | **Medium.** 4G is common, but reliability varies. **Offline-first is mandatory.** | **CONSTRAINT** |

## 5. Strategic Implications for Product

1.  **Mobile-First PWA:** No app store friction. Must load < 2s on 3G.
2.  **Offline Capability:** Menu must be cacheable.
3.  **Local Payments:** Integration with local gateways (Telebirr, M-Pesa) is a Phase 2 moat.
4.  **Simplicity:** Admin panel must be "WhatsApp simple".

### Go/No-Go for Development?
**GO.** The market gap is clear.
