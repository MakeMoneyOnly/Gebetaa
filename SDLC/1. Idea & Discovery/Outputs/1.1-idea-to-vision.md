**Status:** COMPLETED

## 1. Idea Canvas

### Raw Input

A multi-tenant digital menu and restaurant infrastructure platform, specifically tailored for emerging markets (starting with Ethiopia). It aims to replace physical menus to handle frequent price changes due to inflation and provide data-driven tooling to small/medium restaurants.

### Core Insight

Existing enterprise solutions (Toast, Square) are too expensive and heavy for emerging markets. Local restaurants encounter "inflation friction" (reprinting costs) and "data blindness" (no insights). There is a "white space" for a "Lightweight Toast" that is mobile-first, offline-capable, and ultra-simple.

### Problem Hypothesis

- **Whom:** Small to medium restaurants in high-inflation economies (e.g., Ethiopia).
- **Problem:**
    1.  Frequent price changes require expensive menu reprinting ($200-800/batch).
    2.  Lack of data on sales/margins ("gut feeling" operations).
    3.  Inefficient manual upselling by staff.
    4.  Fragmented multi-location management for chains.
- **Context:** Unreliable internet, older smartphones, cash-heavy economy.

### Solution Hypothesis

Build a multi-tenant SaaS platform offering:

1.  **Dynamic QR Menus:** Real-time price updates (no reprinting).
2.  **Smart Upselling:** Simple algorithmic suggestions to boost AOV.
3.  **Menu Intelligence:** Basic "Popular vs Profitable" analytics.
4.  **Emerging Market Tech:** Offline mode, local payments, WhatsApp integration, lightweight PWA.

### Value Hypothesis

Restaurants will pay ($10-50/mo) because we:

1.  Eliminate reprinting costs (immediate ROI).
2.  Increase Average Order Value (AOV) by ~20% via smart upselling.
3.  Provide multi-location control which they currently lack.

## 2. Idea Stress Test (5 Challenges)

| Challenge           | Assessment                                                                                                                                             | Status  |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| **Desirability**    | **High.** Validated pain points: Inflation (reprinting), Upselling capability, Multi-location chaos. 20% resistance to QR exists but can be mitigated. | ✅ PASS |
| **Feasibility**     | **High.** Core tech is standard webapp (Next.js/Supabase). Offline mode requires careful PWA engineering but is solvable.                              | ✅ PASS |
| **Viability**       | **Medium/High.** SaaS subscription ($10-50) is viable if volume is achieved. Future revenue from payments/transactions (Phase 2).                      | ✅ PASS |
| **Differentiation** | **Strong.** Competitors are either too expensive (Toast) or too basic (PDF viewers). "Smart Upselling" + "Local Adaptation" is the moat.               | ✅ PASS |
| **Timing**          | **Good.** Inflation is a forcing function. Smartphone penetration is high enough. "Tech fatigue" is a risk but simplicity effectively counters it.     | ✅ PASS |

## 3. Problem-Solution Fit Hypothesis

**We believe that** Restaurant Owners in emerging markets (e.g., Ethiopia)
**Have a problem with** Keeping menu prices updated during inflation and increasing average check size
**Because** Physical menus are static/expensive to print, and staff variance makes manual upselling unreliable
**And if we** Provide a dynamic QR menu system with automated upselling and local payment integration
**They will** Switch from physical menus and pay a monthly subscription
**We will know this is true when** We onboard 50 paying locations and see a measurable (>15%) increase in their AOV.

## 4. Competitive Landscape (Initial)

- **Tier 1 (Global Giants):** Toast, Square. **Verdict:** Too expensive, require hardware, no local support.
- **Tier 2 (Basic QR Tools):** Menu Tiger, PDF hosts. **Verdict:** Poor UX, no "intelligence", no offline mode.
- **Tier 3 (Local/None):** WhatsApp ordering, "Do Nothing". **Verdict:** Our main competition is the "status quo" (paper menus).
- **Differentiation:** We are the **"Smart, Local Operating System"**—not just a menu viewer. We offer _Analytics_ and _Upselling_ that basic tools lack, at a price global giants can't match.

---

## 5. Feasibility Pre-Check

- **Technical Complexity:** **Medium.** Standard CRUD + Real-time (Supabase) + PWA constraints.
- **Resource Requirements:** **Moderate.** Small engineering team can build MVP.
- **Regulatory:** **Low** for MVP (Info only). **High** for Phase 2 (Payments).
- **Risk:** Adoption friction (staff resistance). Mitigation: "Call Waiter" button and staff tips features.

## 6. ICE-R Score

| Dimension      | Score  | Rationale                                                      |
| :------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**     | 8      | High potential to transform restaurant operations and revenue. |
| **Confidence** | 7      | Research backed (`RESTAURANT.md`), strong market signals.      |
| **Ease**       | 8      | MVP is straightforward Web/SaaS engineering.                   |
| **Risk**       | 4      | Main risk is market adoption/cultural resistance to QR.        |
| **Total**      | **42** | (8 _ 7 _ 8) / 4 = 112 (Normalized Scale: Very High Potential)  |

## 7. Vision Statement

### One-Liner

We simply restaurant operations in emerging markets by turning static menus into dynamic, revenue-generating digital assets.

### Elevator Pitch

For restaurant owners in high-inflation emerging markets who struggle with menu costs and low margins, **Gebeta** (working title) is an infrastructure platform that provides dynamic pricing and smart upselling. Unlike expensive US-based POS systems or basic PDF viewers, we offer an affordable, offline-capable solution that actively helps restaurants make more money through data.

### North Star Vision

To become the "Toast of Africa" — the operating system running every interaction in a restaurant, from ordering to payment to supply chain, across the continent.

### Anti-Vision

We are NOT building a food delivery aggregator (like UberEats). We are a B2B infrastructure partner, not a B2C marketplace.

## 8. Recommendation

### Verdict: **PROCEED** 🚀

### Next Steps (Phase 1.2 - Market Discovery)

- Since we have significant research in `RESTAURANT.md`, we will formalize the **Market Discovery** artifacts to confirm our Persona and Competitive nuances.
- Proceed to **Phase 2 (Strategy)** immediately after.
