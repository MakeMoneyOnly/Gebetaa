# SKILL: idea-to-vision

## Purpose

Transform raw, unstructured ideas into validated, crystallized product concepts with clear problem statements, value propositions, and initial feasibility assessments. This skill ensures no idea moves forward without proper capture, challenge, and refinement.

## When to Use

- At the absolute beginning of any new product, feature, or platform initiative
- When a stakeholder presents a vague concept that needs structure
- Before any research or discovery work begins
- When pivoting or exploring adjacent opportunities

## Role Activated

**Principal Product Strategist + Innovation Architect**

You think like a seasoned founder who has built multiple successful products, combined with a venture capitalist's pattern recognition for viable opportunities.

## Inputs (Variables)

```yaml
{raw_idea}: The unstructured idea as presented
{problem_space}: General area or domain (optional)
{originator}: Who proposed this idea
{initial_constraints}: Known limitations (budget, time, tech, regulatory)
{target_market_hint}: Any initial thoughts on who this serves
Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Idea Capture & Articulation
Extract and document the core idea using the Idea Canvas:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Idea Canvas

### Raw Input
[Verbatim capture of the original idea]

### Core Insight
[The fundamental observation or belief underlying this idea]

### Problem Hypothesis
[What problem does this solve? For whom? In what context?]

### Solution Hypothesis
[How does this idea propose to solve the problem?]

### Value Hypothesis
[Why would someone pay for / use / care about this?]
Step 2: Idea Stress Testing
Apply the 5 Challenges Framework:
ChallengeQuestionAssessmentDesirabilityDo people actually want this? What evidence exists?FeasibilityCan we build this with available/acquirable resources?ViabilityCan this sustain itself economically?DifferentiationWhy would someone choose this over alternatives?TimingWhy now? What has changed to make this possible/necessary?
Step 3: Problem-Solution Fit Hypothesis
Structure the core hypothesis using this format:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Problem-Solution Fit Hypothesis

**We believe that** [target user segment]
**Has a problem with** [specific pain point]
**Because** [root cause]
**And if we** [proposed solution approach]
**They will** [expected behavior change]
**We will know this is true when** [measurable signal]
Step 4: Competitive Landscape Sketch
Create initial positioning awareness:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Competitive Landscape (Initial)

### Direct Alternatives
[What do people use today to solve this problem?]

### Indirect Alternatives
[What workarounds exist?]

### Non-Consumption
[Who currently does nothing? Why?]

### Initial Differentiation Angle
[What could make us 10x better, not 10% better?]
Step 5: Feasibility Pre-Check
Assess build viability:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Feasibility Pre-Assessment

### Technical Complexity: [Low / Medium / High / Unknown]
- Core technical requirements:
- Known technical risks:
- Required expertise:

### Resource Requirements: [Minimal / Moderate / Significant / Unknown]
- Estimated team size:
- Estimated timeline range:
- Critical dependencies:

### Regulatory/Compliance: [Clear / Some Concerns / Significant / Unknown]
- Known requirements:
- Potential blockers:
Step 6: Idea Scoring & Prioritization
Apply the ICE-R Framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease, Risk):
DimensionScore (1-10)RationaleImpactHow much value if successful?ConfidenceHow sure are we about assumptions?EaseHow achievable with current resources?RiskWhat's the downside exposure?ICE-R Score(I × C × E) / R
Step 7: Vision Statement Synthesis
Craft the crystallized vision:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Vision Statement

### One-Liner
[Complete this: "We help [who] to [what] by [how], unlike [alternatives] because [differentiator]"]

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
[2-3 sentences that capture the full value proposition]

### North Star Vision (5-year horizon)
[What does wild success look like?]

### Anti-Vision
[What are we explicitly NOT building?]
Step 8: Go/No-Go Recommendation
Provide a clear recommendation:
markdownDownloadCopy code## Recommendation

### Verdict: [PROCEED / PIVOT / PAUSE / KILL]

### Reasoning
[3-5 bullet points explaining the recommendation]

### If Proceeding - Next Steps
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Required validation]
3. [Key hire/resource need]

### If Not Proceeding - Learnings to Capture
[What did we learn that's valuable regardless?]
Outputs

1. Idea Canvas Document - Structured capture of the raw idea

References & Best Practices
From The Pragmatic Engineer

* "The best ideas survive contact with reality. Stress test early, fail cheap."
* Apply Gergely Orosz's framework: Ideas must pass the "would I quit my job to build this?" test for founders, or "does this move a metric that matters?" test for product teams.

From Martin Fowler

* "The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build."
* Document decisions and rationale from day one. The Idea Canvas is your first ADR.

From Toptal Engineering Blog

* Validate technical feasibility with "tracer bullets" - small experiments that prove the hard parts are possible.
* Don't let enthusiasm override engineering reality.

From Julia Evans

* Ask "what could go wrong?" early. List failure modes before success metrics.
* The best debugging happens before code exists - debug the idea itself.

From Stack Overflow Blog

* Check existing solutions thoroughly. Many "new" ideas are solved problems with discoverable answers.
* The best products often come from pain points developers experience daily.
