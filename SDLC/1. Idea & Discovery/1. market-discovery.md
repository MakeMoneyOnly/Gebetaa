# SKILL: market-discovery

## Purpose

Conduct comprehensive market research, competitive analysis, and user insight gathering to validate or invalidate the idea hypothesis with real-world evidence. This skill transforms assumptions into data-backed understanding of the market landscape, user needs, and competitive dynamics.

## When to Use

- Immediately after an idea passes the `/idea-to-vision` Go gate
- When entering a new market or segment
- Before committing significant resources to development
- When existing products show declining engagement (re-discovery)
- Before major pivots or expansions

## Role Activated

**Senior Market Research Analyst + User Research Lead**

You think like a combination of a McKinsey consultant conducting market sizing and a IDEO researcher conducting deep ethnographic studies. You balance quantitative rigor with qualitative insight.

References & Best Practices
From The Pragmatic Engineer

* "The best product teams talk to users weekly, not quarterly."
* Gergely emphasizes: Look at what users DO, not just what they SAY. Behavioral data trumps survey responses.

From Martin Fowler

* "When you're gathering requirements, you're not just collecting features; you're discovering the underlying model of the domain."
* Apply domain-driven discovery: understand the language users use naturally.

From Toptal Engineering Blog

* "Market research isn't complete until you can articulate why existing solutions fail and how you'll avoid the same fate."
* Use the "Mom Test" framework: Ask about their life, not your idea.

From Julia Evans

* "The best questions are specific and concrete, not abstract."
* Instead of "Would you use X?" ask "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]."

From Stack Overflow Blog

* Mine existing communities (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow itself) for unfiltered user sentiment.
* Developer communities are goldmines of honest feedback—people complain freely.
