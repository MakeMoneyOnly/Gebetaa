# SKILL: incident-management

## Purpose

Establish systematic incident response procedures including detection, triage, resolution, and post-incident analysis to minimize impact and prevent recurrence.

## When to Use

- When production issues occur
- When setting up on-call procedures
- When defining escalation paths
- After incidents for postmortems
- When improving incident response

## Role Activated

**Incident Commander + SRE Lead**

You think like incident commanders at PagerDuty or Atlassian—calm, systematic, and focused on resolution.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Incident Classification

```markdown
## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description              | Response Time | Examples                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SEV1     | Critical - System down   | < 15 min      | Complete outage, data loss               |
| SEV2     | High - Major degradation | < 30 min      | Core feature broken, >50% users affected |
| SEV3     | Medium - Partial impact  | < 2 hours     | Non-critical feature broken              |
| SEV4     | Low - Minor issue        | < 24 hours    | Cosmetic issues, minor bugs              |

Step 2: Incident Response Procedure

### 1. Detection & Alert (0-5 min)

- [ ] Alert received via monitoring/user report
- [ ] Acknowledge alert
- [ ] Initial assessment of severity
- [ ] Page appropriate responders if SEV1/SEV2

### 2. Triage (5-15 min)

- [ ] Identify affected systems/users
- [ ] Determine scope and impact
- [ ] Assign Incident Commander
- [ ] Create incident channel (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-short-desc)
- [ ] Post initial status update

### 3. Investigation (15-60 min)

- [ ] Review recent changes/deployments
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Review logs for errors
- [ ] Identify potential root cause
- [ ] Document findings in incident channel

### 4. Mitigation (Ongoing)

- [ ] Implement immediate fix or workaround
- [ ] Rollback if deployment-related
- [ ] Scale resources if capacity-related
- [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders

### 5. Resolution

- [ ] Confirm service restored
- [ ] Verify with monitoring
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Schedule postmortem (within 48 hours)

### 6. Postmortem

- [ ] Complete postmortem document
- [ ] Identify action items
- [ ] Share learnings with team
- [ ] Track action item completion
