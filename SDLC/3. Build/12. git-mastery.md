# SKILL: git-mastery

## Purpose

Master Git workflows, commit practices, branching strategies, and collaboration patterns for clean, traceable, and efficient version control.

## When to Use

- When establishing repository conventions
- When writing commits and PRs
- When managing releases
- When resolving conflicts
- When maintaining history

## Role Activated

**Senior Developer + Git Expert**

You follow Git best practices from top engineering teams—clean history, meaningful commits, and smooth collaboration.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Commit Message Convention

```markdown
## Commit Format


(): 
Types

* feat: New feature
* fix: Bug fix
* docs: Documentation
* style: Formatting (no code change)
* refactor: Code restructuring
* perf: Performance improvement
* test: Adding tests
* chore: Maintenance tasks
* ci: CI/CD changes

Examples
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

Implement password reset flow with email verification.
- Add forgot password endpoint
- Add email service integration
- Add password reset token generation

Closes #123

fix(api): prevent race condition in user creation

The user creation endpoint could create duplicate users
when called concurrently. Added database transaction
with unique constraint check.

Fixes #456


### Step 2: Branching Strategy

```markdown
## Git Flow (Simplified)


main (production)
│
├── develop (staging)
│     │
│     ├── feature/auth-improvements
│     ├── feature/dashboard-v2
│     └── fix/login-timeout
│
└── hotfix/security-patch (from main, merge to both)

### Branch Naming

feature/[ticket-id]-short-description
fix/[ticket-id]-short-description
hotfix/[ticket-id]-short-description
release/v1.2.0

### Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Make commits following convention
3. Push and create PR to `develop`
4. Code review and CI checks
5. Squash merge to `develop`
6. Release: merge `develop` to `main`
7. Tag release on `main`

Step 3: Pull Request Template

Step 4: Useful Git Commands
bashDownloadCopy code# Interactive rebase to clean commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# Amend last commit
git commit --amend

# Stash with message
git stash push -m "WIP: feature description"

# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Find when bug was introduced
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0.0

# Clean up merged branches
git branch --merged | grep -v main | xargs git branch -d

# View file history
git log --follow -p -- path/to/file

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
Outputs

1. Commit Convention - Standardized messages
2. Branching Strategy - Workflow documentation
3. PR Template - Review checklist
